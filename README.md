Unofficial, anonymous repository for MAESTRO: MAsked Encoding Set TRansformer with Self-DistillaiOn. The purpose of this code is for validation of the method, an official deanonymized repository will be published after decision.

## Overview

MAESTRO is a novel approach to self-supervised set-based representation learning using masked encoding with self-distillation. It is designed to process cytometry data efficiently while maintaining set-invariant properties.
